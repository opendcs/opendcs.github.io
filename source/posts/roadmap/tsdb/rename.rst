During some earlier development the name OpenTSDB was used for our reference 
SQL database implementation. Unfortunately, this is the named used by a popular 
NoSQL Time Series database and can cause confusion. 

The first full release of the 8.0 series will have this database and java packaged
renamed to OpenHydroDb per a vote taken by the developers in 2022.
